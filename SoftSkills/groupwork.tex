\objective{How to learn and work in a collaborative, technical environment without cheating yourself or others.}

\section*{Learning by Teaching} % =================================
This section will talk about the importance of explaining what you are learning to others and helping them succeed as well. Basically the Feynman Technique.
\section*{Time Management} % ============================
This section will talk about the importance of time management and taking small breaks throughout the work session. Basically the Pomodoro Technique.
\section*{Integrity}
A group is only as strong as its weakest member. It's important to This section should discuss what constitutes cheating and how to solve math problems effectively as a group. Do not copy work written on whiteboards. Take notes while solving problems together, then write it down individually later.
\section*{Group Work Algorithms}
Some ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skim reading then 30 minute group meeting together to explain to each other. Start solving each new homework problem. Total time about 1 hour.
	\item Meet together with someone after class as soon as possible. Take 5-7 minutes to explain what the section is about, why it is important, etc. Then start talking through the homework problems that you previously started. If you get stuck, move on to the next problem. Take a small 5 minute break every half-hour or so.
