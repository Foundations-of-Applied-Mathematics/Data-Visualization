# Data Visualization

Here are some things we learned in class.

### Day 1: January 10

We learned how to critique a data visualization.

[A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

### Day 2: January 12

We talked about the [Gapminder](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) data vis.

Data is more interesting than the visualization.

Tools you could use:

+ Tableau (free for students)
+ matplotlib
+ [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (if you know javascript)
+ Bokeh
+ [Processing](https://processing.org/)

I added some files in the repo to help you load your data set in Pandas (python).

Due next time: get your hands on a data set you want to visualize

### Day 3: January 17

Today we are talking about [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) and multidimensional visualizations.

[FiveThirtyEight Dear Data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-listening-and-wow-did-you-deliver/)

Have a visualization to present next time.

### Day 4: January 19

Group critiques. Focus on next steps.
Use Tufte's principles of analytical visualization.
Also, if you are plotting map data, I added some files above to help.
Make sure you install matplotlib's basemap by running `conda install basemap`
in your terminal.

For next time, collect some personal data for a Dear Data project.
