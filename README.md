##Schedule and Links

Below is what we talked about in class as well as general notes.

### Day 5: January 24

ANNOUNCEMENT: Formal class will no longer be held on Thursdays to not conflict with the soft skills seminar. All are encouraged to attend the soft skills seminar.

Instead of Thursday meetings as a class, I will be holding personal reviews at a time of your choosing on Thursday.

Go to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSqLDCsrzKlF4G4GbHl_ICxONLsGzOTRkiB9G3NK9iI/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up for a 10 minute slot on Thursday. If none of these times work for you, contact me and schedule another time.

With a partner, critique the following visualizations:

+ [xkcd Earth Temperature](https://xkcd.com/1732/)
+ [Polygraph Film Dialogue](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/)
+ [FiveThirtyEight Gun Deaths](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/)

*Visual Variables*

+ position
+ size
+ hue
+ saturation
+ value
+ shape

More about Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) [here](http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/).

*Drawing exercise*

**Homework**: Schedule a Thursday portfolio review with me.

### Day 4: January 19

Group critiques. Focus on next steps.

Use Tufte's principles of analytical visualization.
Also, if you are plotting map data, I added some files above to help.
If you are using your personal computer, make sure you install matplotlib's basemap by running `conda install basemap` in your terminal.

**Due next time**: choose an ACME lab to redesign and show potential employers.

### Day 3: January 17

Today we are talking about [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) and multidimensional visualizations.

[FiveThirtyEight Dear Data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-listening-and-wow-did-you-deliver/)

**Due next time**: Have a visualization to present.

### Day 2: January 12

We talked about the [Gapminder](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) data vis.

Data is more interesting than the visualization.

Tools you could use:

+ Tableau (free for students)
+ matplotlib
+ [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (if you know javascript)
+ Bokeh
+ [Processing](https://processing.org/)

I added some files in the repo to help you load your data set in Pandas (python).

**Due next time**: Get your hands on a data set you want to visualize.

### Day 1: January 10

We learned how to critique a data visualization.
